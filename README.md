# Student_Exam_Marks_Prediction

Hello,

I am submitting my project “SmartScore: Predicting Student Performance with ML” on this GitHub repository as part of our Machine Learning coursework.

This project uses:

✅ Linear Regression to predict final exam scores based on study time.
✅ Logistic Regression to predict pass/fail using attendance and study time.
✅ K-Means Clustering to group students based on study habits and attendance patterns.

The repository includes:

A clean dataset (student_data.csv) with 25 sample records.

Fully commented Python code for each part using pandas, sklearn, and matplotlib.

Visualizations and interpretation guidelines for understanding model outputs.

This project helped me practice regression, classification, and clustering on real-world education data, and improved my understanding of practical ML workflows.

Thank you for reviewing my submission.

Best regards,

Manu Kumar
